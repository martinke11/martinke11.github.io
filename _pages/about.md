I am a Masters Candidate at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy specializing in Data Science. Throughout my time at Harris, I have taking courses in Statistics and Program Evaluation, Python Programming, Linear Algebra, Machine Learning, including Advanced Computer Vision and Deep Learning and NLP, Data Engineering and Cloud Engineering. Here is a list of Projects that I have completed and am currently working on:

1) For the final project in Data Engineering, I worked with a team of four where I designed and implemented a comprehensive data schema using relational database management system (RDBMS) MySQL to streamline the organization of The Metropolitan Museum of Art's extensive artwork database (500,000+ objects), enhancing data accessibility and integrity for varied analytical applications.

2) For my Final project in Data and Programming, I completed a sentiment analysis on major US new headlines related to Israel, Hamas and Palestine, focusing on subjectivity and word usage. I utilized NewsAPI.org to collect thousands of news headlines and automated the data extraction and management processes with custom Python scripts, storing the results in a GitHub repository for streamlined access and reproducibility. Additionally, I created an interactive dashboard using Shiny and Plotly, which dynamically visualized the analysis and highlighted trends in the media portrayal of these geopolitical entities.

3) I am currently working with two other students on a Final Project in Advanced Computer Vision and Deep Learning, which involves training a classification and segmentation model to identify deforestation in Satellite images of the Amazon Rainforest.

4) I am currently working on a Final Project in Big Data and High-Performance Computing/Cloud Engineering where I am constructing a data pipeline and system to identify crater formations in Gaza using satellite imagery from Landsat and Sentinel. This involves pulling satellite images from S3 and using transfer models, which run in parallel. I'm leveraging TensorFlow for model training and Apache Spark for distributed processing to handle this data efficiently. To support these tasks, I've established an AWS infrastructure, utilizing EC2 instances for computational tasks and S3 for storing data.

Driven by a profound commitment to public service and intellectual curiosity, my academic and professional pursuits in data science are rooted in a passion for utilizing technology to address complex societal issues. I am particularly motivated by the potential of data-driven insights to influence public policy and create meaningful change. Looking forward, I aim to leverage my expertise in data science to contribute to evidence-based policy making, aspiring to roles that allow me to shape and implement innovative solutions to global challenges. My ultimate goal is to lead initiatives that bridge the gap between data science and public policy, ensuring that technological advancements serve the public good and enhance community well-being on a broad scale.
